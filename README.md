# Indoor Positioning System Using IN100 BLE NanoBeacons

### This repo is created as a part of a Thesis in the University of Tartu (2025)

#### Abstract:
This thesis evaluates the suitability of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol and dedicated
IN100 BLE NanoBeacons for indoor positioning, implementing and testing the solution on the
iOS platform. Position estimates are produced by fusing an RSSI-based trilateration method
with a smartphone inertial-sensor based Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) algorithm. The
results are weighted through dynamic confidence classes. The application presents the result
on an interactive map, where its functionality is comparable to modern navigation apps. The
system was tested both in the University of Tartuâ€™s Delta building and in a home environment.
Examined deployment parameters were beacon-density, signal strength and maintenance, also
a cost analysis of the covered hardware, installation and configuration effort. The findings
confirm that a BLE-beacon network is a technically viable and cost-effective alternative to Wi-
Fi-based indoor positioning systems.
